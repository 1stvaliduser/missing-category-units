# Missing Category Units
This mod aims to fill in the gaps of the categories not covered by the vanilla units.

### Special Air
Specialize in speed and energy.

Dart -> Arrow -> Spear -> Javelin -> Harpoon

### Support Naval
Specialize in healing and unit factories. (T2 might produce monos, T5 might produce polys.)

Rana -> Renidae -> Protidae -> Renigata -> Tempolax

### Special Naval
Possibly snipers. T2, 4, and 5 will probably sap. Maybe a unit factory T3 that produces dart. T5 will definetely produce dart.
